# avbotz_submittion

Hello, this is Charles Sun and this repository contains my submittion for the AVBotz Software Entrance Assignment.

A few things I have to say. First is that I've submitted this fairly late - 8:30pm - but I just wanted to make sure everything is perfect. Also, the text responce questions are in .txt format, which means depending on what software you use, the line might not be wrapped to a new line. Please don't judge me :)

For the bonus question, I provided two .cpp files, main.cpp and main_old.cpp; main_old.cpp contains the first prototype of the algorithm using the second method I described in step 4E. However that solution quickly became too messy as more bugs popped up and it doesn't work for some specific coordinates and times (I actually know why but it is too messy to fix). So I tried the 4th method, where I had to do more extremely long winded algebra factorizating and expanding [Attachment 4]. I got it to work - shown in main.cpp - for all the values I tested. It might break for some or take a long time but I haven't come across such situations yet. I also wanted to expand everything [Attachment 5] so I can try factoring and calculating the roots directly, but it got too long and needs complex numbers which is a little bit too complex. *badumtsss*

P.S. I heard that apparently I could use linear algebra but ehhhh.
